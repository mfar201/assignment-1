                    I
                    am ready to do everything that has to be done, that must be done. People say learning Web
                    Development is
                    not an easy feat. Whereas, I say everything is easy if you have the dedication to do it. Hard work
                    is a
                    must! I hope I can achieve my goal and make my family and friends happy.</p>

            <p class="p-margin-bottom">For every programmer curiosity and the urge of being good at something is
                always the motivation. If you
                know why you want to learn web development, go challenge yourself, that is motivation enough. For me it
                was the desire to make and build my own website. Then in the process I found this beautiful world of
                programming.</p>
